  "description": "\t\t\t\t\t\tA fast, synchronous Objective-C wrapper around BSD sockets for iOS and OS X.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSend and receive raw bytes over a socket as fast as possible. Includes methods\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor transferring files while optionally computing a checksum for verification.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUse this class if fast network communication is what you need. If you want to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdo something else while your network operations finish, then an asynchronous\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAPI might be better.\n",
