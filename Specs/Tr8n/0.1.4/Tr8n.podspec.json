  "description": "  \n  Tr8n framework provides a powerful internationalization/translation solution for mobile applications. It reduces the number of tasks needed for translation to the minumum.\n  \n  All you need to do in your app is to include the Tr8n header file, initialize the framework and use the various [Tr8n translate: @\"Your text\"] methods to mark your content for translation.\n  \n  The SDK comes with its own language selector and even with In-App Translator - where you can ask your users to help you translate your app right from within your app!!!\n\n  Tr8n SDK integrates with tr8nhub.com service, where you can manage the entire translation process - enable languages, invite translators, manage phrases, and much more. \n  Once the translations are done, they will be automatically downloaded and installed by the SDK in your app. Everything is done realtime - you DO NOT need to submit a new application to the App Store. You can simply enable a language on tr8nhub service and it will be immediately available in the language selector in your application.\n\n  You can learn more about how it works by running the sample applications:\n\n  Demo app that comes with the SDK:\n  https://github.com/tr8n/tr8n_objc_clientsdk/tree/master/Project \n\n  Wammer application that shows how the SDK can be integrated into a messaging app:\n  https://github.com/tr8n/tr8n_samples_wammer\n\n  More applications will be available soon, so keep an eye on:\n  https://github.com/tr8n \n\n  The framework is already used by a number of application on the App Store, including \"Birthday Calendar +\" app. Install it and see how it works. \n\n  Happy translating!\n",
